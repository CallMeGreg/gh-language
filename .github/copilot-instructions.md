# General guidelines

- Use Go and the cobra library for command-line applications.
- Use [pterm](https://github.com/pterm/pterm) for terminal output.
- Keep reusable code in the `common.go` file.
- Always describe changes in a detailed plan before making them.
- Update the README file with any new features or changes.

# API preference

- When using the GitHub API, prefer using the REST API over the GraphQL API.
- An exception to this rule is when listing organizations for an enterprise. For this kind of task, always use the GraphQL API.
- If there is no confirmed API endpoint, do not fabricate an endpoint.

# GitHub GraphQL API Rate Limits

- If you exceed your primary rate limit, the response status will still be 200, but you will receive an error message, and the value of the x-ratelimit-remaining header will be 0. You should not retry your request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header.
- If you exceed a secondary rate limit, the response status will be 200 or 403, and you will receive an error message that indicates that you hit a secondary rate limit. If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not retry your request until after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
- Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.

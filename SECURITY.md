## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a security vulnerability with this project, please [open up a new private vulnerability report](https://github.com/CallMeGreg/gh-language/security/advisories/new).

I will respond at my earliest convenience, and open up a public security advisory after triaging the concern.
